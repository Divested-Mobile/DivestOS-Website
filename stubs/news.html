						<h3>Pending Removal of Silence<a href="#dropSilence">¶</a></h3>
						<h4>What is happening</h4>
						<p>DivestOS has included Silence as the SMS app since the very beginning. However this app has been completely unmaintained for well over two years now. It has many annoying bugs and likely has unfound security issues. DivestOS plans to remove Silence and replace it back with the LineageOS fork of the AOSP SMS app.</p>
						<h4>What steps you need to take</h4>
						<p>In order to prevent loss of your message history, or to keep the app if you want to continue using it please follow these steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Open Silence and export an encrypted backup, this will ensure you can recover if the app fails to persist.</li>
							<li>Download the current version of Silence from one of these mirrors: <a href="https://f-droid.org/repo/org.smssecure.smssecure_211.apk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">F-Droid</a>, <a href="/misc/org.smssecure.smssecure_211.apk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Divested</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/prebuilt_apps/-/raw/master/android_vendor_FDroid_PrebuiltApps/packages/Silence.apk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://cloudflare.f-droid.org/repo/org.smssecure.smssecure_211.apk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a></li>

						</ul>
						<h4>Impact</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Affected devices: alioth, Amber, avicii, bramble, coral, davinci, discovery, flame, guacamole, guacamoleb, hotdog, hotdogb, lmi, pioneer, redfin, sunfish, vayu, voyager, z2_plus</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Timeline</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Jan 13th: <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=35306eb23814444bd4021f8a1c3047d3cb0c8b2b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Patches</a> for CVE-2021-4203 were added to the Linux patch repo.</li>
							<li>Builds containing this patch were released on Jan 14th and 16th.</li>
							<li>Jan 16th @ 20:08: A report was received of guacamole not booting, initially suspected to be firmware related.</li>
							<li>Jan 16th @ 23:02: The report of guacamole not booting was confirmed and ruled out firmware.</li>
							<li>Jan 16th @ 23:18: All guacamole* and hotdog* builds were pulled.</li>
							<li>Using the error message ("creds_are_invalid") and `git blame` the CVE-2021-4203 patches were identified as the issue.</li>
							<li>Jan 16th @ 23:45: All devices that included the patch were pulled.</li>
							<li>In-depth checking of why this broke led to <a href="https://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/DEBUG_CREDENTIALS.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DEBUG_CREDENTIALS</a> catching the NULL credential objects, due to missing <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f06bc03339ad4c1baa964a5f0606247ac1c3c50b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> patch.</li>
							<li>This is confirmed by <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/872035/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">looking</a> at the Linux stable patches released on Oct 6th, both patches are included.</li>
							<li>Jan 17th @ 00:24: CVE patchers were regenerated and rebuilds of the affected devices started.</li>
							<li>Jan 17th @ 10:31: Rebuilds of the 15 affected 18.1 devices started uploading. Finished @ 13:10.</li>
							<li>Jan 17th @ 13:11: Rebuilds of the 5 affected 17.1 devices started uploading. Finished @ 14:50.</li>

						<h4>Steps to take if you installed the broken build</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>If your bootloader is unlocked or your recovery is still functional, simply flash the newest fixed build.</li>
							<li>If your bootloader is locked and your recovery is not functional, you will have to unlock (which wipes your device) and reinstall the newest fixed build. Then restore your data from backup.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Steps to take as a user in the future</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Keep a copy of the most recent known working build for your device.</li>
							<li>Backup your data before every update.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Steps we plan to take in the future</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Acquire more devices for testing, to catch such issues before release.</li>

						<h3>January 26th 2021 Update<a href="#2021-01">¶</a></h3>
						<h4>System Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>January ASB builds were released between the 10th and 14th.</li>
							<li>Rebuilds were published on the 24th thru 26th primarily for CVE patcher updates.</li>
							<li>IMS/VoLTE was made working on supported devices. <a href="https://forum.f-droid.org/uploads/default/original/2X/5/53ee160037c0d5683a65629320d04f41c19f31bb.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">image</a></li>
							<li>CNE was removed after being briefly included in the Dec/Jan builds. This removal breaks Wi-Fi calling, but is likely worth the security benefits.</li>
							<li>The deblobber received tweaks to better handle more property edits. <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/divestos-build/-/commit/b99e1865fe9a108c024f335c7ac36d7db9a355d9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">commit</a></li>

							<li>The exec-based spawning feature from GrapheneOS was disabled. We likely failed to port it over correctly and the result is many subtle breakages.</li>
							<li>All versions now include the LineageOS 17.1 APN list for better cell carrier compatibility. <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/divestos-build/-/commit/e62afb602b6566f643f0fe74a9d33d67ec4c058c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">commit</a></li>

							<li>[upstream] Updated to January ASB.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>mata has long-standing audio issues, Lineage team has been trying to fix them. Currently the earpiece speaker works on calls, but the loud speaker cannot have its volume adjusted.</li>
							<li>The microphone issue on shamu was resolved, was caused by our removal of some voice recognition blobs (which are required for adspd bring-up). <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/divestos-build/-/commit/3b8750cdff7722fae94b4b5cd11bb87c20ef13a9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">commit</a></li>
