						<h3>Settings to optionally change after install<a href="#settings">¶</a></h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Setting a lockscreen password of 12+ characters is extremely recommended, at the minimum please use a 8+ digit pin. Pattern locks are not recommended.</li>
							<li>If your device has 4GB or more RAM, it is strongly recommended to enable 'Secure App Spawning' in Settings > Security.</li>
							<li>Block native debugging via Settings > Security > "Allow native debugging" > Disabled.</li>
							<li>Enable USB restrictions via Settings > Privacy > Trust > Restrict USB > Allow USB connections when locked.</li>
							<li>Enable strict LTE mode if VoLTE works via Settings > Network & internet > SIMs > [your carrier/SIM] > Preferred network type > LTE only.</li>
							<li>Ensure 2G usage is blocked via Settings > Network & internet > SIMs > [your carrier/SIM] > Allow 2G > Disabled.</li>
							<li>Enable automatic idle reboots via Settings > Security > Auto reboot > 24 hours.</li>
							<li>Enable automatic Bluetooth turn off via Settings > Connected devices > Bluetooth timeout > 10 minutes.</li>
							<li>Relock your <a href="/pages/bootloader#fastbootLocking">bootloader</a> if supported.</li>
							<li>Have a limited/expensive mobile data plan? Check out our saving data page <a href="/pages/saving_data">here</a>.</li>
							<li>14.1/15.1 only: Enable 'Privacy Guard' for extra control over application permissions.</li>
							<li>Utilizing and configuring 'Profiles' for your uses/environment can increase battery life and potentially enhance security.</li>
							<li>Disabling lockscreen shortcuts can potentially reduce potential lockscreen bypass vulnerabilities.</li>
							<li>Enabling 'Increasing ring volume' is very nice if you don't use it already.</li>
							<li>[DivestOS currently ships without VoWiFi support] You may consider disabling Wi-Fi calling to not let your carrier learn such information about IP addresses, access-points, and potentially more accurate location.</li>

						<h3>Physical Protections<a href="#physical">¶</a></h3>
						<h4>Apply a privacy screen protector</h4>
						<p>Privacy screen protectors limit the viewing angles of the screen they are applied to, resulting in a dramatic reduction of what people and cameras around you can see. They can be purchased for around $8 on eBay and similar sites. The glass ones are the best as always, but some older phones seem to only have the plastic film ones available. Be warned, they noticeably reduce the brightness and add an ever so slight screen door effect. If your phone doesn't have the brightest of screens it will become near-impossible to see in sunlight and also impact camera/videos experience.</p>
						<h4>Keep a faraday bag handy</h4>
						<p>Faraday bags for phones can be purchased for around $10. They are absolutely essential if you have a phone without a removable battery and are in high-risk areas often. Putting your phone in their inner flap will prevent all relevant radio signals coming/going to your phone.</p>
						<h4>Wear a hat</h4>
						<p>Plain baseball hats can be purchased for around $6 and provide a decent reduction in visibility of your face to cameras.</p>
