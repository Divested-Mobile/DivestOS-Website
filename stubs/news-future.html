						<h3>XXX Update<a href="#XXXX-XX">Â¶</a></h3>
						<h4>System Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Users who only had the `DivestOS WebView` repo in their F-Droid client are strongly recommended to add the `DivestOS Official` repo in order to keep receiving out-of-band WebView updates.</li>
							<li>After installing this February update it is recommended to remove the `DivestOS WebView` repository from your F-Droid client.</li>
							<li>20.0 release candidate #1 February ASB builds were published on February 14th.</li>
							<li>18.1 release candidate #1 February ASB builds were published on February 12th.</li>
							<li>17.1 rebuilds were published on February 12th.</li>
							<li>Backported patches (from Google/Linaro) and a workaround (from GrapheneOS) have been used to fix/mitigate an upstream Linux issue that causes IPv6 privacy addresses to be persisted across networks.</li>
							<li>17.1 release candidate #1 February ASB builds were published on February 11th.</li>
							<li>17.1 and higher now has a dedicated toggle switch for SUPL use, thanks to a patch from GrapheneOS. Older versions can still use the less robust method of removing the `supl` APN type from activated APN.</li>
							<li>15.1, 16.0, 17.1, and 18.1 rebuilds were published on February 10th.</li>

							<li>The GrapheneOS kernel hardening patches have been updated, adding support for Linux 5.10 and 5.15 along with updated patches for 4.x series.</li>
							<li>The AOSP bug on 19.1+ which causes special app permissions to be randomly reset on reboot has been fixed thanks to GrapheneOS.</li>

							<li>The following apps have been dramatically minified: Hypatia, Extirpater, GMaps WV, MotionLock, and SupportDivestOS. Please be sure to report any issues.</li>
							<li>Hypatia has been updated to reduce hash collisions after the last update trimmed them too short.</li>
