						<h3>XXX Update<a href="#XXXX-XX">Â¶</a></h3>
						<h4>System Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>14.1, 15.1, 16.0, and 17.1 rebuilds were published August 24th.</li>
							<li>18.1 and higher now block use of select quick settings tiles when the screen is locked, thanks to patches from GrapheneOS.</li>
							<li>20.0 now has eSIM support on Pixel 4 series and newer along with the Fairphone 4. This works without any dependencies on Play Services/microG, the Google LPAd, or any Google servers. The LPA component is provided by @PeterCxy's OpenEUICC app. The proprietary Google support app is still used for secure element initialization and firmware updates, but has no Internet permission and cannot interact with other apps thanks to patches from GrapheneOS. This makes DivestOS the first system to allow users to activate and use eSIMs without the typicial privacy concerns of Google interactions. Tested working with both JMP.chat and silent.link on bluejay.</li>
							<li>19.1 and higher now removes ImsServiceEntitlement and Car/DebuggingRestrictionController, which both contained proprietary Google libraries.</li>
							<li>Numerous proprietary libraries from the AOSP static Maven repository are now removed to ensure they aren't used.</li>
							<li>18.1 and higher have a minor performance fix for the /etc/hosts cache mechanism, thanks to @danielk43.</li>
							<li>14.1 through 16.0 now uses libAAC from 17.1, thanks to @syphyr.</li>
							<li>14.1 now uses FreeType from 18.1, thanks to @syphyr.</li>
							<li>14.1 has had many CVE backports for FFmpeg and BoringSSL, thanks to @syphyr.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Device Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>With Pixel 4 series finally booting, issues were found with the deblobber which broke the camera, however thanks to chat member 'penguin' for providing logs and testing the issue has been resolved by adding back the Pixel 4 specific Motion Sense blobs.</li>
							<li>After many years of being unable to boot, both Pixel 3 and 4 series have been reported working recently. Specifically blueline, crosshatch, sargo, and flame. The actual cause is still unknown.</li>
