						<h3>XXX Update<a href="#XXXX-XX">Â¶</a></h3>
						<h4>System Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>20.0 now has eSIM support on Pixel 3 series and newer along with the Fairphone 4. This works without any dependencies on Play Services/microG, the Google LPAd, or any Google servers. The LPA component is provided by @PeterCxy's OpenEUICC app. The proprietary Google support app is still used for secure element initialization and firmware updates, but has no Internet permission and cannot interact with other apps thanks to patches from GrapheneOS. This makes DivestOS the first system to allow users the use of eSIMs without Google learning of their use and the privacy concerns typically associated with them.</li>
							<li>19.1 and higher now removes ImsServiceEntitlement and Car/DebuggingRestrictionController, which both contained proprietary Google libraries.</li>
							<li>Numerous proprietary libraries from the AOSP static Maven repository are now removed to ensure they aren't used.</li>
							<li>18.1 and higher have a minor performance fix for the /etc/hosts cache mechanism, thanks to @danielk43.</li>
							<li>14.1 through 16.0 has had many CVE backports for FreeType, thanks to @syphyr.</li>
							<li>14.1 has had many CVE backports for FFmpeg and BoringSSL, thanks to @syphyr.</li>
