					<p>Things you should do soon after installing</p>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>Install some apps!</h3>
						<p>We created a list of recommended and tested apps <a href="/pages/apps.php">here</a>.<br>You can also get access to even more apps by enabling the included 'IzzyOnDroid' repo; be warned however that while all apps are open source, not all are fully FOSS. Read more <a href="https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/info" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here at IzzySoft.</a></p>

					<div class="section">
						<h3>Optional settings to change</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Utilizing and configuring 'Profiles' for your uses/environment can increase battery life and potentially enhance security.</li>
							<li>Disabling lockscreen shortcuts can potentially reduce potential lockscreen bypass vulnerabilities</li>
							<li>Enable hiding of notification content for enhanced privacy</li>
							<li>Enable 'Privacy Guard' for extra control over application permissions</li>
							<li>Enabling 'Increasing ring volume' is very nice if you don't use it already</li>
							<li>Setting a lockscreen password of 12+ characters is extremely recommended, at the minimum please use a 6+ digit pin</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>Enable a location provider or two</h3>
						<p>In order to obtain your location without GPS a location provider is necessary. These can utilize known locations of cell towers and Wi-Fi access points in order to determine your location. Backends can either be powered by offline or online databases.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>For devices where GPS will be on occasionally (such as phones) we recommend simply enabling DejaVu. DejaVu is an offline local database.</li>
							<li>For devices without GPS (such as tablets) if necessary you can enable the MozillaNLP backend. This backend sends nearby Wi-Fi access points to Mozilla's online location lookup backend.</li>
							<li>To enable either backend: microG Settings > UnifiedNlp Settings > Configure location backends</li>
							<li>There are additional backends avaialble via F-Droid.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>Advanced changes</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Flash a firmware deblobber from <a href="/pages/extras.html">here</a> to further remove proprietary code from your device</li>
							<li>Flash the corresponding recovery for your device for extra verification of updates</li>
							<li>Consider relocking your bootloader. Warning: Some devices (eg. Motorola) will hard brick upon relocking</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>Apply a polarized screen protector</h3>
						<p>Polzarized screen protectors limit the viewing angles of the screen they are applied to, resuling in a dramatic reduction of what people and cameras around you can see. They can be purchased for around $4 on eBay and similar sites. Use the following keywords when searching <code>privacy screen protector $phone</code>. The glass ones are the best as always, but some older phones seem to only have the plastic film ones available.</p>

					<div class="section">
						<h3>To support proprietary apps</h3>
						<ul style="color:#f44336;">
							<li><strike>To get (proprietary) apps from the Goolge Play Store, install 'Yalp Store' from F-Droid</strike></li>
							<li><strike>To pass (the proprietary) SafetyNet checks enable the microG F-Droid repo and install 'microG DroidGuard Helper' then enable it under microG Settings > SafetyNet</strike></li>
						</ul>
