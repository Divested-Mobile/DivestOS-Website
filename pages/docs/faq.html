						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
						<p></p>
					</header>

					<section id="content">
						<h4>What phone do you recommend?</h4>
						<p>For a phone that 'just works', we recommended basically any Nexus or Pixel device. They are easy to unlock and get great support from the community.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Nexus 5X: Best price/performance ($120)</li>
							<li>Nexus 4: Fantastic budget phone ($40)</li>
							<li>Pixel (OG): Best performance ($225)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you however want the absolute best bang for your buck, there is the LG G3 D852. It is the Canadian model, but works in most of North America and some other parts of the world. They can be purchased for $70. And rock some great specs: 3GB of RAM, LTE, AC Wi-Fi, 1440P screen, OIS camera, removable battery, expandable storage, overclock well, a headphone jack, etc. The biggest downside is the extremely tedious and frustrating process to find all the needed tools, downgrade, root, flash a recovery/ROM, and need for a Windows box.</p>

						<h4>What about that gaping hole that is the baseband processor?</h4>
						<p>Eh, we are in dire need of free hardware, but it simply doesn't exist right now. This is better then nothing.</p>

						<!--<h4>Why are you hosting on GitHub if its proprietary?</h4>
						<p>Because a lot of people have GitHub accounts which reduces the barrier to entry for contributing. GitLab.com is still too slow, GitLab CE is too resource hungry, and Gitea/Gogs is a bit all over right now.</p>-->

						<h4>Why isn't DivestOS based on X ROM?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>CopperheadOS: Current license, limited device compatibility, <strike>and PaX porting difficulty</strike></li>
							<li>OmniROM: Lack of device maintenance, and features</li>
						</ul>
						<p>LineageOS also has superior device compatibility across the board.</p>

						<h4>Can you support X device, that doesn't have an (un)official LineageOS port?</h4>
						<p>Nope.</p>

						<h4>Can you support X device, that does have an official LineageOS port?</h4>
						<p>If there is enough demand, yes.</p>

						<h4>Will you add that one theme engine?</h4>
						<p>No.</p>

						<h4>Why did you remove the weather providers?</h4>
						<p>Because they all transmit your location on a somewhat fixed schedule over HTTP.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you removed Trebuchet's RemoteFolder malware?</h4>
						<p>Because it doesn't do anything unless configured and will be eventually removed once its rebased upon the newer AOSP launcher (which has already happened in LineageOS 15.1).</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you updated the WebView or replaced it with Chromium Monochrome?</h4>
						<p>- Because building Chromium is a hassle<br>- The default browser is Gecko<br>- Hopefully once LineageOS 15.1 is stable they'll actually keep it updated.</p>

						<h4>Why did you only partially remove VoLTE?</h4>
						<p>Because it is necessary on some carriers to be able to call. It also allows you to stay on LTE longer which is all around a very good thing.</p>

						<h4>Should I use the 'LTE Only' option (if available)?</h4>
						<p>If your device has VoLTE support or is an LTE tablet then YES! LTE has both stronger encryption compared to 3G and is end-to-end encrypted to the cell tower. Intercepting 2G and 3G via a fake cell tower is easy since 2G has no encryption and 3G can be cracked in near-realtime. LTE however requires much more expensive devices that aren't as widely available. As always there are various other ways for your device to be compromised or to have your data intercepted, but every bit helps!</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you completely changed the default DNS servers?</h4>
						<p>Right now OpenNIC AnyCast is used for DNS fallback and for tethering. Switching it by default for cell would break VoLTE, SMS, MMS, and Visual Voicemail. And switching it for Wi-Fi could potentially break access to some LAN devices.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you changed the captive portal check server?</h4>
						<p>Changing it from the current Google one would allow your device to be easily picked out from others as its basically always the first network request after connecting.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you replaced the graphics drivers with mesa/llvmpipe (like Replicant)?</h4>
						<p>Because we haven't figured that out yet. If someone from Replicant (or anywhere else) wants to wrap those patches up in a nice tidy ball, that'd be amazing. However even then we aren't sure if the performance/battery hit is worth it.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you replaced the Adreno drivers with freedreno?</h4>
						<p>Because all of the devices use kernels that either don't have or have an old version of freedreno.</p>

						<h4>Why isn't root included?</h4>
						<p>Because you don't <i>really</i> need it, and it just increases the attack surface.</p>

						<h4>Why are you wasting your time with Android? Its clear that Google has been slowly killing AOSP every release!</h4>
						<p>Android is a legitimately fantastic operating system and no other mobile platform has as many open source apps as it does.</p>
