						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
						<p></p>
					</header>

					<section id="content">
						<h4>What about that gaping hole that is the baseband processor?</h4>
						<p>Eh, we are in dire need of free hardware, but it simply doesn't exist right now. This is better then nothing.</p>

						<h4>Why are you hosting on GitHub if its proprietary?</h4>
						<p>Because a lot of people have GitHub accounts which reduces the barrier to entry for contributing. GitLab.com is still too slow, GitLab CE is too resource hungry, and Gitea/Gogs is a bit all over right now.</p>

						<h4>Why isn't DivestOS based on X ROM?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>CopperheadOS: Current license and PaX porting difficulty</li>
							<li>OmniROM: Lack of device maintenance, and features</li>
							<li>PA/AOSPA: Is barely alive and had a lot of proprietary features until recently</li>
						</ul>
						<p>And LineageOS has superior device compatibility.</p>

						<h4>Can you support X device, that doesn't have an (un)official LineageOS port?</h4>
						<p>Nope</p>

						<h4>Can you support X device, that does have an official LineageOS port?</h4>
						<p>If there is enough demand, yes.</p>

						<h4>Will you add that one theme engine?</h4>
						<p>No. Pray that der Scheff will resurrect CMTE.</p>

						<h4>Why did you remove the weather providers?</h4>
						<p>Because they all transmit your location on a somewhat fixed schedule over HTTP.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you removed Trebuchet's RemoteFolder malware?</h4>
						<p>Because it doesn't do anything unless configured and will be eventually removed once its rebased upon the newer AOSP launcher.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you updated the WebView or replaced it with Chromium Monochrome?</h4>
						<p>Because building Chromium is a hassle and hopefully once LineageOS 15.0 is stable they'll actually keep it updated.</p>

						<h4>Why did you only partially remove VoLTE?</h4>
						<p>Because it is necessary on some carriers to be able to call. It also allows you to stay on LTE longer which is all around a very good thing.</p>

						<h4>Should I use the 'LTE Only' option?</h4>
						<p>If your device has VoLTE support or is an LTE tablet then YES! LTE has both stronger encryption compared to 3G and is end-to-end encrypted to the cell tower. Intercepting 2G and 3G via a fake cell tower is easy since 2G has no encryption and 3G can be cracked in realtime. LTE however requires much more expensive devices that aren't as widely available. As always there are various other ways for you device to be compromised or to have your data intercepted, but every bit helps!</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you changed the default DNS servers?</h4>
						<p>We're considering switching to OpenNIC's Anycast servers, but thats a bit iffy.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you changed the captive portal check server?</h4>
						<p>Changing it from the current Google one would allow your device to be easily picked out from others as its basically always the first network request after connecting.</p>

						<h4>Why isn't root included?</h4>
						<p>Because you don't <i>really</i> need it, and it just increases the attack surface.</p>

						<h4>Why are you wasting your time with Android? Its clear that Google has been slowly killing AOSP every release!</h4>
						<p>Android is a legitimately fantastic operating system and no other mobile platform has as many open source apps as it does.</p>
