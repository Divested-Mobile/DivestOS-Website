						<h4>General Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>November and December ASB builds have been released.</li>
							<li>Mull is now on its 3rd Fenix based release, with the latest 84.1.0. Huge thanks to @relan for their build scripts. <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mull-fenix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">repo link</a></li>

							<li>All 15.1 builds and higher are now fully dexpreopted, this allows for reduced memory usage and also decreased boot times on FDE devices.</li>
							<li>TCP SACK is no longer disabled. SACK PANIC has now been patched on nearly all kernels supported. It has valuable bandwidth saving benefits.</li>
							<li>There have been many new CVE patches, especially for 3.18 kernels.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Roster Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>clark has been updated from 14.1 to 17.1 (potential modem issues). In-place upgrade has been tested to work, but your mileage may vary.</li>

							<li>Most text based content served up will now be compressed either by deflate or brotli.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Other things</h4>
						<ul>

							<li>3G is starting to be rapidly phased out, meaning calls with most carriers will not be possible unless IMS/VoLTE works on your device.</li>
							<li>Heads up: LineageOS will most likely be dropping official 16.0 builds once 18.0/18.1 is released.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Future work</h4>

						<h3>October 10th 2020 Update<a href="#2020-11">¶</a></h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Most 3.4 devices should expect 40-100 more kernel CVE patches. <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/kernel_patches/commit/4f9f775f05c4feea9fabeaa61658be027571b4a6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">git commit</a></li>

							<li>Mull is now severely out of date. There hasn't been the time to rebase it. It is strongly suggested to use Bromite or the new Fennec F-Droid until then. Bromite repo is already included in DivestOS F-Droid.</li>
							<li>victara build failed last month due to recovery image being too large, however it is now once again available.</li>
							<li>h850 and zenfone3 builds have been pulled as they were last updated in 2018 and 2019 respectively.</li>
