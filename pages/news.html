					<div class="section" id="2020-12">
						<h3>December 2020 Update<a href="#2020-12">¶</a></h3>
						<h4>General Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>November and December ASB builds have been released.</li>
							<li>Mull is now on its 3rd Fenix based release, with the latest 84.1.0. Huge thanks to @relan for their build scripts. <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mull-fenix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">repo link</a></li>
							<li>Hypatia has been updated to show database release/update dates in addition to a multi-threading fix.</li>
							<li>Etar is now used for the calendar app across all versions.</li>
							<li>A handful of more proprietary blob variants have been removed.</li>
							<li>Vendor build fingerprints are now all replaced.</li>
							<li>Lots of miscellaneous fixes and cleanup.</li>
							<li>All 15.1 builds and higher are now fully dexpreopted, this allows for reduced memory usage and also decreased boot times on FDE devices.</li>
							<li>TCP SACK is no longer disabled. SACK PANIC has now been patched on nearly all kernels supported. It has valuable bandwidth saving benefits.</li>
							<li>There have been many new CVE patches, especially for 3.18 kernels.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Roster Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>clark has been updated from 14.1 to 17.1 (potential modem issues). In-place upgrade to work, but your mileage may vary.</li>
							<li>flo has been updated from 15.1 to 17.1, but requires re-partitioning.</li>
							<li>cheeseburger/dumpling are compiling for 17.1, but not booting.</li>
							<li>coral and flame 17.1 builds are available (untested).</li>
							<li>rs988 and h990 17.1 builds are available (untested).</li>
							<li>yellowstone 16.0 builds are available (untested).</li>
							<li>h870 15.1 builds are available (untested).</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Website Updates</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Paragraphs now have links for easy saving/sharing.</li>
							<li>Browser, recommended apps, and functionality tables have all been updated.</li>
							<li>A handful of credit updates.</li>
							<li>There is now a captcha to access the device downloads page. It works without JavaScript, and has audio support.</li>
							<li>There is a new vanity onion address divestoseb5nncsydt7zzf5hrfg44md4bxqjs5ifcv4t7gt7u6ohjyyd.onion. The old address also still works. <a href="https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tool used</a></li>
							<li>Most pages are now cached by the browser.</li>
							<li>Most text based content served up will now be compressed either by deflate or brotli.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Other things</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Old DivestOS patches have been used to remove AmbientSDK from Replicant. <a href="https://git.replicant.us/replicant/packages_apps_Contacts/tag/?h=cm-13-before-ambientsdk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">git tag</a></li>
							<li>3G is starting to be rapidly phased out, meaning calls with most carriers will not be possible unless IMS/VoLTE works on your device.</li>
							<li>Heads up: LineageOS will most likely be dropping official 16.0 builds once 18.0/18.1 is released.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Future work</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Test how much breakage the deblobber is causing to the IMS stack, or if that is upstream.</li>
							<li>Finish importing <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/kernel_patches/-/commit/6e7fc4c8f83081e7634eb1e73f58dd433930b0a8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a></li>
							<li>Add back AOSP patching support to the CVE patcher. It is undecided how to best implement it.</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="section" id="2020-11">
						<h3>October 2020 Update<a href="#2020-11">¶</a></h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Most 3.4 devices should expect 40-100 more kernel CVE patches. <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/kernel_patches/commit/4f9f775f05c4feea9fabeaa61658be027571b4a6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">git commit</a></li>
							<li>Most 3.18 devices should expect 10-40 more kernel CVE patches. <a href="https://gitlab.com/cip-project/cip-kernel/cip-kernel-sec/-/commit/5a07867289e1236fd35c894860abca79b9ce402f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">git commit</a></li>
							<li>A handful of other kernel CVE patches are available for all other devices as per usual.</li>
							<li>Lots of work has been done on making the CVE patcher easier for other projects to use. <a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/cve_checker" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">repo link</a></li>
							<li>Mull is now severely out of date. There hasn't been the time to rebase it. It is strongly suggested to use Bromite or the new Fennec F-Droid until then. Bromite repo is already included in DivestOS F-Droid.</li>
							<li>victara build failed last month due to recovery image being too large, however it is now once again available.</li>
							<li>h850 and zenfone3 builds have been pulled as they were last updated in 2018 and 2019 respectively.</li>
							<li>[Upstream] Updated to October security bulletin.</li>
							<li>[Upstream] Updated WebView to Chromium 86.0.4240.75, has many security fixes.</li>
							<li>[Upstream] klte and shamu have had many upstream changes, worth testing if you have the time.</li>
							<li>11/R builds will likely not be available until March with most devices hopefully being updated by May.</li>
