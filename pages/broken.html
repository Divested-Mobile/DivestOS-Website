						<h3>Apps<a href="#appIssues">¶</a></h3>
						<h4 id="mull">Mull<a href="#mull">¶</a></h4>
						<ul>
							<li>On DivestOS 19.1 and 20.0 the initial install of Mull will not have Internet access, go to its `App info` screen then `Mobile data & Wi-Fi` and enable `Allow network access`.</li>
							<li>Dark mode for websites is disabled due to resist fingerprinting. Please do not disable RFP.</li>
							<li>Refresh rate is capped to 60hz due to resist fingerprinting. Please do not disable RFP.</li>
							<li>If audio/video content fails to play in private tabs navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>browser.privatebrowsing.forceMediaMemoryCache</code> to false, this is however a privacy risk.</li>
							<li>Mull has strict certificate revocation checks. The CA revocation servers are frequently down/blocked/inaccessible and will result in a "Secure Connection Failed" error. Navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>security.OCSP.require</code> to false, this is however a security and privacy risk.</li>
							<li>Mull has strict certificate pinning. If you are using a proxy or VPN that does HTTPS manipulation you'll encounter a "Secure Connection Failed" error. Navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>security.cert_pinning.enforcement_level</code> from 2 to 1, this is however a security and privacy risk.</li>
							<li>Mull has stripped referrers. This often breaks loading of images on websites with hotlink protection. Navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>network.http.referer.XOriginPolicy</code> from 2 to 1, this is however a privacy risk.</li>
							<li>Mull has WebAssembly disabled by default. This is often used for web apps. Navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>javascript.options.wasm</code> to true if needed, this is however a security risk.</li>
							<li>Mull has WebGL disabled by default. This is often used for games and maps. Navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>webgl.disabled</code> to false if needed, this is however a privacy risk.</li>
							<li>Mull has WebRTC disabled by default. This is often used for audio/video calls. Navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>media.peerconnection.enabled</code> to true if needed, this is however a privacy risk.</li>
							<li>If the button to "Accept the risk & continue" doesn't work: navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>browser.ssl_override_behavior</code> from 1 to 2.</li>
							<li>If you want to access Onions using Mull and Orbot: navigate to <code>about:config</code> and change <code>network.dns.blockDotOnion</code> to false. Tor Browser for Android however should be preferred.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4 id="others">Others<a href="#others">¶</a></h4>
						<ul>
							<li>F-Droid will not suggest updates for Mull if the version on the official F-Droid repo is older than the DivestOS repo. Enable "Unstable updates" in its Settings for faster updates.</li>
							<li>F-Droid will reset its database on the second start in rare cases.</li>
							<li>To use gmail.com with FairEmail you must use an App Password.</li>
							<li>Silence will crash if first started without a SIM-card inserted. [upstream]</li>
							<li>Simple Gallery will fail to render images on select older devices. Disable 'deep zooming' in its settings to workaround.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>System<a href="#system">¶</a></h3>
						<h4 id="unsupported">Not Supported<a href="#unsupported">¶</a></h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Changing device identifiers like the IMEI is NOT supported and is illegal in many countries.</li>
							<li>Encryption cannot be disabled.</li>
							<li>Fonts cannot be easily added to the system.</li>
							<li>Google Apps or microG or Sandboxed Play Services are NOT supported.</li>
							<li>Other WebView providers such as Bromite are not currently supported. They were briefly supported in the past but caused boot issues on 15.1 for unknown reasons.</li>
							<li>Remote desktop host apps like AnyDesk and TeamViewer are not supported. They rely on special system permissions enabled by vendors signing helper apps on their behalf.</li>
							<li>Root is <a href="index.php?page=faq#rootSupport">NOT supported</a>.</li>
							<li>SELinux is always enforcing and cannot be set permissive or disabled.</li>
							<li>Signature spoofing is NOT supported.</li>
							<li>Torrents will not be offered for downloads/updates. They don't work well on mobile and they leak IP addresses of users.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4 id="notes">Notes<a href="#notes">¶</a></h4>
						<ul>
							<li>16.0 and higher will warn when running an app that is not targeting Android 9.0 API for the first time.</li>
							<li>17.1 and higher will warn when running a 32-bit app for the first time on a 64-bit device. Sometimes this warning is not accurate.</li>
							<li>Compiling is non-trivial and has many undocumented steps.</li>
							<li>Devices using 'encryptable=footer' in their fstab will not be encrypted by default. These devices typically are unable to be encrypted on the very first boot.</li>
							<li>If your device is not detected by your computer use a USB 2.0 port. If you don't have any USB 2.0 ports use a USB 2.0 hub. If that still doesn't work try another cable.</li>
							<li>IMS/VoLTE may or may not work. [upstream? deblobber? carrier?]</li>
							<li>Incremental updates will often fail to successfully apply on non update-engine devices. [releasetools]</li>
							<li>It is strongly recommended to leave OEM unlocked enabled to allow for recovery if unbootable and locked.</li>
							<li>Sensors Off toggle on 17.1/18.1 also turns off the camera and microphone.</li>
							<li>SIM ToolKit is not included and may cause issues with some carriers. STK however can be installed afterwards, you can request it if you need it.</li>
							<li>'Storage Manager' is non-functional in some cases.</li>
							<li>The ADB toggle in developer options has absolutely zero effect on whether or not you can use ADB in recovery.</li>
							<li>The default password for Android encryption is `defaultpassword`.</li>
							<li>The DivestOS recovery is automatically installed on supported devices each successful boot. If you externally change it, you must not boot the system to use it.</li>
							<li>The 'enable native code debugging'/ptrace_scope toggle does nothing on devices without stacked YAMA, ie. kernels before 3.10.</li>
							<li>The Updater may not show very recent updates due to the server's 2 hour cache.</li>
							<li>The Updater will show the currently installed update, this is expected.</li>
							<li>When sideloading a final percent of 90-94% is expected and not signs of failure.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4 id="papercuts">Papercuts<a href="#papercuts">¶</a></h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Block encrypted devices will fail to shutdown from secure boot screen on 18.1. Force power off via power button to workaround.</li>
							<li>Bluetooth phone calls may not work.</li>
							<li>Devices with less than 2GB of RAM *will* likely out-of-memory more often than usual. [various]</li>
							<li>Disabling Storage Manager is strongly recommended, it may choose to delete your files after 90 days otherwise.</li>
							<li>Fingerprint readers may work inconsistently.</li>
							<li>If `fastboot update` fails on identifying device you can extract the zip and `fastboot flash` each partition manually.</li>
							<li>If Seedvault is set to backup to a USB flash drive and it is later plugged in, the automatically started backup may fail. If so, you must invoke the backup manually.</li>
							<li>If you have banking or game apps that do not work, ensure the `Enable native code debugging` toggle is enabled in Settings > Security. Such apps use ptrace as a form of crude anti-tamper mechanism.</li>
							<li>MediaProvider error toast on some boots. [permission issue?]<a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/divestos-build/-/issues/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">[tracking]</a></li>
							<li>Most devices will take up to the full 12.5 minutes to acquire a GPS lock. Please test using GPSTest app with *clear* and *direct* line of sky. [deblobber]<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.android.gpstest.osmdroid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">[link]</a></li>
							<li>Mull is not installed by default, only an empty shim is. F-Droid will prompt you to "update" it on first run which will install it.</li>
							<li>Phone call audio is distorted sometimes until speaker phone is toggled. [deblobber?]</li>
							<li>Recovery will not be updated on each boot on 14.1. [upstream]</li>
							<li>The changelog link in the Updater links to the LineageOS changelog for your device. However devices Lineage no longer compiles for don't have such a page.</li>
							<li>The secondary user logout button on the lockscreen will overlap the unlock icon on some devices.</li>
							<li>Trebuchet, the launcher, on older versions will randomly enter a half-broken state where you cannot long press any apps. Force stop Trebuchet from Settings or reboot to fix.</li>
							<li>TWRP often cannot decrypt/unlock /data.</li>
							<li>Updater JSON parsing error on 14.1. [upstream?]<a href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/divestos-build/-/issues/2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">[tracking]</a></li>
							<li>When `Private DNS` is enabled for the system, Chromium based browsers will automatically handle DNS themself bypassing the /etc/hosts based blocking function. Disable `Secure DNS` to work around.</li>
							<li>When `Private DNS` is disabled for the system, using anything in the VPN slot will likely bypass the /etc/hosts based blocking function.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4 id="bugs">Bugs<a href="#bugs">¶</a></h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Older Unity engine games will likely crash on 16.0+ due to the hardened memory allocator. A workaround is to install the 32-bit variant of the app. [Unity engine bug]<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-il2cpp-empty-project-crashes-on-launch-with-using-memoryadresses-from-more-than-16gb-of-memory-messages" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">[tracking]</a></li>
							<li>Select older devices running 17.1/10 or higher will fail to connect to 802.11w (optional/required) enabled Wi-Fi networks due to lack of PMF support. [hardware]</li>
							<li>Special permissions of apps may be randomly reset after reboots. This is an unknown and widespread issue affecting many other operating systems.</li>
							<li><strike>'Developer options' will crash on 15.1 due to null PDB handle. Likely fixed in late 2022-02 builds</strike></li>
							<li><strike>Fenix based browsers such as a 'Mull' or 'Fennec F-Droid' might cause a reboot on launch. Please report your device if it does to be fixed.</strike></li>
