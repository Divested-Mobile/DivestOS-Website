						<h3>General Issues</h3>

						<h4>F-Droid repeatedly installing/updating apps</h4>
						<p>This is a known issue in F-Droid 1.1-1.2 and will (hopefully) be fixed by upstream soon. As a temporary workaround you can either manually clear F-Droid's data (cache sometimes works) or reboot your device.</p>
						<p>Issues: #1311, #1031, #1209, #1271, #1374, #1392, #1409, #1415, #1420, #1429, #1441, #1445</p>

						<h4>Upon first install device gets stuck at 'Encrypting...' screen</h4>
						<p>LineageOS adds duplicate fstab entries to most devices in order to allow the user to choose between an ext4 or F2FS /data partition. If you improperly wiped your device beforehand (erased instead of formatted /data) the system won't know what to do and will just hang there. Simply format /data via TWRP or fastboot to fix.</p>

						<h3>Device Specific Issues</h3>

						<h4>Mako: Never booting on first install</h4>
						<p>This was introduced after kernel changes on/around April 18th and is related to the sound server never starting. The workaround is to wait three or so minutes, force it off, and power it back on. After two or so minutes it should boot fine.</p>

						<h4>Clark: No mobile service</h4>
						<p>TWRP is required for installing updates as it contains some extra tools that are needed by the special installer script. Without these tools the modem files never get extracted properly.</p>

						<h4>LG G3: No radio, no sensors, no brightness control, etc.</h4>
						<p>Please update your modem to a version extracted from an Android 5.0/V20x image. If you cannot find an image available for your specific model, you can extract a .KDZ to get the .DZ, extract that and flash the relevant files (dbi, factory, modem, rpm, tz). Please note you <i>must</i> use the aboot and laf partitions from a V10x image or else your device will end up in bulk mode. The version should show as 00053 under Settings > About > Baseband version</p>

						<h4>Apollo/Thor: Wi-Fi stops working after a while</h4>
						<p>Apollo/Thor is no longer officially supported by LineageOS and has not had any fixes by its device maintainers in a long while. As a workaround you can toggle Airplane Mode for 20 seconds.</p>

						<h4>Apollo/Thor: Boot-looping into recovery</h4>
						<p>If you installed a system update with a recovery that doesn't know where the /misc partition is the update flag will never be cleared. The fix is to run the following<br><code>$ fastboot format misc</code></p>

						<h3>Issues after upgrading to 15.1 from 14.1</h3>

						<h4>Black screen or only wallpaper showing</h4>
						<p>Pull down from the notification drawer to get into Settings, enable Development Mode, turn on ADB and then run the following<br><code>$ adb shell am start org.lineageos.setupwizard/org.lineageos.setupwizard.SetupWizardExitActivity</code></p>

						<h4>No mobile service</h4>
						<p>Select the proper APN for your carrier under Settings > Network > Mobile network > Advanced > Access Point Names</p>
