						<h3>On Messaging Apps</h3>
						<p>Please see the messaging tables page <a href="/index.php?page=messengers">here</a></p>
						<h3>On Keyboard Apps</h3>
						<p>Do not ever use any keyboard apps that are proprietary and/or require network permission. It doesn't matter how great that autocomplete is, its garbage if its sending everything you type to a server somewhere just to be data mined. It doesn't even matter if it has a "good" privacy policy or if you trust the creator, sending it away incurs the chance of being intercepted by a less trusted party.</p>
						<h3>On Web Browsers</h3>
						<p>Please see the browser tables page <a href="/index.php?page=browsers">here</a></p>
