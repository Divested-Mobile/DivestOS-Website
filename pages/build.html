					<h2>Build Guide (WIP)</h2>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>You want to build for yourself? Awesome!
						<br>First things first, you're going to need a pretty decent computer if you want timely builds.
						<ul>
							<li>For builds under 3 hours you'll want to have at least a powerful quad core processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 7200RPM drive.</li>
							<li>For builds under an hour you'll want to have a processor that gets a score of 10k+ or higher on <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/CPU_mega_page.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Passmark</a>, 16GB+ of RAM, a 7200RPM drive and a 128GB SSD for ccache.</li>
							<li>If you plan on building in a virtual machine, in terms of performance: KVM > Hyper-V > VMWare > VirtualBox</li>

							<li>You'll need a lot of available free space on your drives</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Source Code: 70GB + ~1-2GB per device</li>
								<li>30GB per device for building</li>
								<li>10GB per device for optional caching</li>
								<li>250MB-650MB for each resulting build if you want to archive</li>
								<li>4GB for two target-files for a device to optionally generate incremental updates</li>
								<li>All in all having a 500GB 7200RPM drive and a 128GB SSD is a good combo</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<br>Second you'll want to have a decent Internet connection to download the source code and OS dependencies, 100Mbps is recommended.
						<br>Lastly you'll need to have an excellent cooling solution, your computer will be running at full load for quite some time.</p>

						<h3>Installing Dependencies</h3>
						<p>Run the few commands below to get your system up to date and install all necessary dependencies.</p>
						<h4>On Arch Linux</h4>
							<p>@p4block has created a handy metapackage for installing the necessary dependencies, use your favorite AUR helper to install it. There is also a more minimal one included in our build repository that you can install with makepkg.</p>
							<pre><code>sudo pacman -Syu
yaourt -S lineageos-devel firejail
sudo paccache -rk0</code></pre>

						<h4>On Fedora</h4>
							<p>The latest Fedora release is recommended. Some dependencies are missing.</p>
							<pre><code>sudo dnf update

sudo dnf install @development-tools java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel android-tools git gnupg flex bison gperf SDL wxGTK squashfs-tools curl zlib ncurses schedtool perl-Switch zip unzip libxslt python2-virtualenv bc rsync xml2 lzop pngcrush ImageMagick ccache maven gradle ninja-build ncurses-devel ncurses-devel.i686</code></pre>

						<h4>On Ubuntu</h4>
							<p>We recommend 16.10, newer should work fine with little change.</p>
							<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt full-upgrade && sudo apt -f install && sudo apt autoremove
sudo ln -s /usr/include/asm-generic /usr/include/asm;

sudo apt install autoconf automake bc bison build-essential ccache curl expat flex g++ gawk gcc gcc-multilib git-core g++-multilib gnupg gperf gradle lib32ncurses5-dev lib32z1-dev lib32z-dev libc6-dev libc6-dev-i386 libcap-dev libcloog-isl-dev libesd0-dev libexpat1-dev libgcc1:i386 libgl1-mesa-dev libgmp-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libtool libx11-dev libxml2 libxml2-utils lzop maven ncurses-dev openjdk-8-jdk patch pkg-config pngcrush python-all-dev schedtool squashfs-tools subversion texinfo unzip x11proto-core-dev xsltproc zip zlib1g-dev imagemagick repo firejail

sudo apt clean</code></pre>
						<h4>On Any</h4>
							<pre><code>echo "export TZ=:/etc/localtime" >> .bashrc
echo "export EXPERIMENTAL_USE_JAVA8=true" >> .bashrc</code></pre>
					</div>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>Creating a Workspace</h3>
						<h4>Setting up Firejail (optional)</h4>
						<p>For extra security of your host machine, you can run the entire build process in a fairly restricted sandbox with minimal performance impact. We've already upstreamed a profile for just this task.</p>
						<pre><code>firejail --profile=/etc/firejail/aosp.profile bash</code></pre>
						<h4>Checking out the code</h4>
						<p>Okay, now you'll want to create the workspace. This is highly recommended to be on a separate drive from your system drive.</p>
						<pre><code>git clone https://git.spotco.us/DivestOS/DivestOS-Build.git DivestOS
cd DivestOS
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir -p Build/LineageOS-15.1/.repo/local_manifests Builds Signing_Keys
cd Build/LineageOS-15.1
ln -s ../../Manifests/Manifest_LAOS-15.1.xml .repo/local_manifests/local_manifest.xml
repo init -u git://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b lineage-15.1
repo sync #This part will take a while

#Some systems have python3 set as default, the build scripts require python2
virtualenv2 venv

#TODO: Signing Keys
cd ../..
nano Scripts/LineageOS-15.1/00init.sh #Update all relevant paths
</code></pre>
					<h4>Setting up ccache (Optional)</h4>
						<p>Use of ccache is highly recommended, its an easy way to dramatically reduce build time and power usage. This is extremely recommended to be on a separate drive from your system drive and your build drive.</p>
						<pre><code>mkdir ccache
echo "export USE_CCACHE=1" >> .bashrc
echo "export CCACHE_DIR=[PATH TO CCACHE DIRECTORY]" >> .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
ccache -M 128GB #Optionally set a size limit</code></pre>
					</div>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>About the Workspace</h3>
						<p>You should become familiar with the workspace.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>/Build - This is where source code and working directory is stored</li>
							<li>/Builds - This is where you should copy signed release builds to</li>
							<li>/Manifests - This is where working repo manifests are stored</li>
							<li>/Misc - This is for storing misc. snippets of anything</li>
							<li>/Patches - This is where all repo patches are stored</li>
							<li>/Scripts - This is where all scripts are stored</li>
							<li>/Signing_Keys - This is the default signing key store, its recommended to store these using gocryptfs or similar.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>Building</h3>
						<p>Now that you've got your workspace ready, lets make an image. Use of bash is required, on Arch Linux you'll need to use a Python virtualenv.</p>
						<pre><code>cd Build/LineageOS-15.1
source venv/bin/activate #Only for python3 default systems
source ../../Scripts/LineageOS-15.1/00init.sh
resetWorkspace
patchWorkspace
buildDevice [device] #or buildAll for all supported devices</code></pre>
						<p>Afterwards you should have flashable zips located in out/target/product/[device] copy them to Builds</p>
					</div>
					<div class="section">
						<h3>Installing</h3>
						<p>Now copy the builds to your device and flash them through your recovery.</p>
					</div>
