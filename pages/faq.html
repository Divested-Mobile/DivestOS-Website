					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<div class="section">
						<h4>What phone do you recommend?</h4>
						<p>For a phone that 'just works', we recommend basically any Nexus or Pixel device. They are easy to unlock (two minutes tops) and receive fantastic support from the community.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Pixel (OG): Best performance ($180-$250)</li>
							<li>Nexus 5X: Best price/performance ($90-$120)</li>
							<li>Nexus 5: Well rounded ($60-$80)</li>
							<li>Nexus 4: Extreme budget ($30-$50)</li>
							<li>Nexus 7: Well rounded tablet ($80)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you want more bang for your buck consider the following alternatives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>LG G3 D852 ($60-$80): An improved Nexus 5; +1GB RAM, microSD slot, removable battery, 1440p screen. Its an absolute pain to get a custom recovery on.</li>
							<li>Nexus 4 with shattered back ($15-$25): Replacement back covers are $8 and take a mere two minutes to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nexus+4+Back+Cover+Replacement/13037" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">replace</a>.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>What about that gaping hole that is the baseband processor?</h4>
						<p>Eh, we are in dire need of free hardware, but it simply doesn't exist right now. This is better then nothing.</p>

						<!--<h4>Why are you hosting on GitHub if its proprietary?</h4>
						<p>Because a lot of people have GitHub accounts which reduces the barrier to entry for contributing. GitLab.com is still too slow, GitLab CE is too resource hungry, and Gitea/Gogs is a bit all over right now.</p>-->

						<h4>Why isn't DivestOS based on X ROM?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>CopperheadOS: Current license, limited device compatibility<strike>, and PaX porting difficulty</strike></li>
							<li>OmniROM: Lack of device maintenance, and features</li>
						</ul>
						<p>LineageOS also has superior device compatibility across the board.</p>

						<h4>Can you support X device, that doesn't have an (un)official LineageOS port?</h4>
						<p>Nope.</p>

						<h4>Can you support X device, that does have an official LineageOS port?</h4>
						<p>If there is enough demand, yes.</p>

						<h4>Will you add that one theme engine?</h4>
						<p>No.</p>

						<h4>Why did you remove the weather providers?</h4>
						<p>Because they all transmit your location on a somewhat fixed schedule over HTTP.</p>

						<h4>Why did you only partially remove VoLTE?</h4>
						<p>Because it is necessary on some carriers to be able to call. It also allows you to stay on LTE longer which is all around a very good thing.</p>

						<h4>Should I use the 'LTE Only' option (if available)?</h4>
						<p>If your device has VoLTE support or is an LTE tablet then YES! LTE has both stronger encryption compared to 3G and is end-to-end encrypted to the cell tower. Intercepting 2G and 3G via a fake cell tower is easy since 2G has no encryption and 3G can be cracked in near-realtime. LTE however requires much more expensive devices that aren't as widely available. As always there are various other ways for your device to be compromised or to have your data intercepted, but every bit helps!</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you completely changed the default DNS servers?</h4>
						<p>Right now OpenNIC AnyCast is used for DNS fallback and for tethering. Switching it by default for cell would break VoLTE, SMS, MMS, and Visual Voicemail. And switching it for Wi-Fi could potentially break access to some LAN devices.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you replaced the graphics drivers with mesa/llvmpipe (like Replicant)?</h4>
						<p>Because we haven't figured that out yet. If someone from Replicant (or anywhere else) wants to wrap those patches up in a nice tidy ball, that'd be amazing. However even then we aren't sure if the performance/battery hit is worth it.</p>

						<h4>Why haven't you replaced the Adreno drivers with freedreno?</h4>
						<p>Because all of the devices use kernels that either don't have or have an old version of freedreno.</p>

						<h4>Why isn't root included?</h4>
						<p>Because you don't <i>really</i> need it, and it just increases the attack surface.</p>

						<h4>Why are you wasting your time with Android? Its clear that Google has been slowly killing AOSP every release!</h4>
						<p>Android is a legitimately fantastic operating system and no other mobile platform has as many open source apps as it does.</p>
