					<h2>Privacy Policy (2018-05-29)</h2>
					<p>User privacy is one of the primary goals of DivestOS. Detailed below is everything you need to know about how your data is handled.</p>
					<p>A note on the GDPR: For the time being we are sadly not 100% GDPR compliant. We are not lawyers but we are pretty sure the only thing we need to do is not log the last two (or four) octets of IP addresses. There are currently no maintained Apache modules that accomplish this, but we are confident that by release there will be. Once that is in place the overall privacy situation for all users will be dramatically improved and we will also be (hopefully) compliant with the GDPR as well.</p>
