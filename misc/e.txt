- Wide device support
- Reasonable pricing for cloud service
- Reasonable markup for device sales
- Maybe the most successful company trying to sell an aftermarket mobile OS to the general public

PDF Viewer
==========

microG
======
- Phones home to Google out of box, despite being "degoogled"
 - https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/android_prebuilts_prebuiltapks_lfs/-/blob/main/GmsCore/microg.xml#L9

System
======
- Uses test-keys for verified boot enablement
 - A system with verified boot must boot yellow state with an aftermarket system
 - The FP4 is known to trust test-keys by default
 - /e/OS when booted on FP4 does not display yellow, meaning test-keys are in use
  - https://forum.fairphone.com/t/bootloader-avb-keys-used-in-roms-for-fairphone-3-4/83448/2

Not Covered (nuanced or needs research/sources)
