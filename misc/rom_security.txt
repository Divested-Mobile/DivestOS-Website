You have five parts that you can use to determine the security of a ROM:
1. the version of Android itself, newer versions have more security features/hardening
2. the ASB patch level, these are essential patches, https://source.android.com/security/bulletin
3. the Pixel ASB patch level, these are recommended patches, https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel
4. the vendor ASB patch level, typically https://www.qualcomm.com/company/product-security/bulletins
5. and lastly the kernel, https://www.kernel.org

- GrapheneOS and CalyxOS only support devices that have all parts updated.

- LineageOS can help with 1, 2, 3, and usually 5, but if a device is out of support by its manufacturer it cannot help with 4.
- DivestOS, beind Lineage based helps with 1, 2, 3, can additionally help 4 a lot with the deblobber, and with 5 a lot using the autopatcher.
- LineageOS and derivatives notably only apply Pixel ASB's to the most recent branch.

- Replicant (6) is behind on all parts.
