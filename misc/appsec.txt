Preface:
- This is a list of dependencies and apps that may have known vulnerabilities
- These apps may not actually expose the vulnerable functionality
- These apps may have mechanisms in places to mitigate the vulnerable functionality
- The primary focus is F-Droid variants of the apps, upstream versions may not be impacted
- This is not meant to be treated as "perfectly correct" or any form of audit, just a cursory check
- This document has been refreshed a handful of times, but it is quite time consuming to keep updated
