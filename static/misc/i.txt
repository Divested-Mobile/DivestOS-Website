Content Blocker
===============
- Called Snort which is likely a trademark violation of Cisco's Snort IDS/IPS
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snort_(software)

- Uses and redistributes blocklists which are licensed against commercial use (NC) or redistribution (ALL RIGHTS RESERVED)
 - https://gitlab.com/iode/os/public/lineage/vendor_extra/-/blob/staging/iode-snort/domains-black
 - They even note these licenses of the blocklists they use here
  - https://iode.tech/en/iodeos-en/

- Runs as root
 - https://gitlab.com/iode/os/public/blocker/iode-snort/-/blob/staging/iode-snort.rc#L23

- Is in C++, likely has memory safety issues
 - https://gitlab.com/iode/os/public/blocker/iode-snort

- Now has an additional premium subscription feature
 - https://iode.tech/en/news/iodeos-premium-launch/
 - This now even moreso is a direct violation of the non-commercial blocklists they are using


Browser
=======
- Based on Fenix and falls behind updates
 - See https://divestos.org/misc/ffa-dates.txt
 - https://gitlab.com/iode/os/apps/iodebrowser
 - https://gitlab.com/iode/os/apps/iode-browser-components

System
======
- No public changelogs so unable to track monthly security updates here
 - See https://divestos.org/misc/a-dates.txt

- Likely falls behind updates
 - Today is 2023/03/24 (March), yet there is no _February_ 2023 update for FP4
  - Check archive.org for https://github.com/iodeOS/ota/releases/tag/v4-FP4
 - Occasional 2-3 month gaps without updates
  - Check archive.org for https://github.com/iodeOS/ota/releases/tag/v3-FP4

- Uses LineageOS WebView which falls behind
 - See https://divestos.org/misc/ch-dates.txt
 - However they do allow use of Bromite, Mulch, and Vanadium which is nice
  - https://forum.fairphone.com/t/fp4-very-privacy-friendly-custom-rom-iodeos/81070/256

- Uses supl.vodafone.com for fallback SUPL

  - https://forum.fairphone.com/t/supl-vodafone-com-supl-google-com/92855

- Enables SUPL MSA mode

 - MSA mode is bad for privacy as it calculates location on the server's end instead of on-device
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-GPS#Modes_of_operation
  - Mode 3 is 1 (MSB) + 2 (MSA)
  - Good news is that supl.google.com doesn't support MSA, but any carrier specificed override may

 - https://www.ntppool.org/en/vendors.html

- Sells the OnePlus 9 which has no bootloader locking support
 - To be fair most of the other devices they sell (eg. Samsung, Sony) have no locking support either.
 - https://calyxos.org/news/2022/07/06/oneplus-android-12-relock-issue/
 - LineageOS also dropped support due to severe issues
  - https://github.com/LineageOS/hudson/commit/1cf941cc0fdb7392c388373b3fdfecb3ed8501b1
