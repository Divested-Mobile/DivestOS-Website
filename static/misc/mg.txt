microG
======
- microG misconception #1: "it doesn't connect to Google servers" & "it spoofs your country"
 - yes it does, see https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/wiki/Google-Network-Connections
 - DivestOS addresses this by noting it when the user opts-in


- microG misconception #2: "it is a fully open source replacement"
 - every app talking to microG does so using the full proprietary Google Play Services library
 - DivestOS addresses this by noting it when the user opts-in


- microG misconception #3: "it is just a normal app" & "it isn't privileged"

 - https://github.com/MSe1969/android_prebuilts_prebuiltapks/blob/master/GmsCore/Android.mk#L24
 - DivestOS addresses this by not installing it at all, keeping it a normal user app, and has no automatically granted permissions


- Has unclear potential to leak location to apps without location permission
 - "Fused Locations: Does not honor AppOps!"
  - https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/wiki/Implementation-Status
 - DivestOS addresses this by not granting any location permissions


- Signature spoofing permission is often poorly implemented:
 - Reference implementation used by L4M, iod√©OS, and /e/OS let the user grant spoofing to any app for any signature

 - Typical "restricted" signature spoofing just restricts to `platform` signed apps

 - CalyxOS has a permission check only used by their GmsCore fork, a package ID check, and only allows spoofing the Google signature
  - https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_frameworks_base/+/12670

 - Here is an example of checking both microG certificate hash and only allows spoofing the Google signature
  - https://github.com/dylangerdaly/platform_frameworks_base/commit/b58aa11631fadab3309a1d9268118bd9f2c2a79f

 - DivestOS is opt-in, checks microG package ID + targetSdk + versionCode + certificate hash, and only allows spoofing the Google signature
