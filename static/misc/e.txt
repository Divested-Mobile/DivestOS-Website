PDF Viewer
==========
- See https://divestos.org/misc/appsec.txt
 - (not updated since 2016, dozens of known security issues)


microG
======
- microG misconceptions
 - See https://divestos.org/misc/mg.txt

- Phones home to Google out of box, despite being "degoogled"
 - https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/android_prebuilts_prebuiltapks_lfs/-/blob/main/GmsCore/microg.xml#L3

- Enables Safetynet checks by default which downloads and executes obfuscated proprietary code from Google
 - https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/android_prebuilts_prebuiltapks_lfs/-/blob/main/GmsCore/microg.xml#L7-8

- Installed as a privileged system app with escalated permissions
 - https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/android_prebuilts_prebuiltapks_lfs/-/blob/main/GmsCore/Android.mk#L24


System
======
- Is consistently behind on the basic monthly AOSP security updates
 - See https://divestos.org/misc/a-dates.txt

- Uses test-keys for verified boot enablement
 - A system with verified boot must boot yellow state with an aftermarket system
 - The FP4 is known to trust test-keys by default
 - /e/OS when booted on FP4 does not display yellow, meaning test-keys are in use
  - https://forum.fairphone.com/t/bootloader-avb-keys-used-in-roms-for-fairphone-3-4/83448/2

- Includes proprietary Google Widevine DRM on nearly all devices
 - https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/devices/android_device_fairphone_FP4/-/blob/119e5d6fd7891ea02389a5e4fce5ad651774954e/proprietary-files.txt#L360-365

  - https://web.archive.org/web/20220720210209/https://e.foundation/e-os/

- Directly uses non-vendored pool.ntp.org address for NTP

 - https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/android_frameworks_base/-/merge_requests/37
 - https://www.ntppool.org/en/vendors.html

- Includes the proprietary Magic Earth app for navigation
 - Despite FOSS user friendly alternatives existing such as OsmAnd and Organic Maps

- Allows arbitrary apps to spoof any signature
 - This is used to support microG but is an insecure implementation
 - https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/android_frameworks_base/-/commit/8489270582746fcd6ba50f21650f82b4616ca5f7

 - This is the same SoC used in the `Brax Phone` and `Simple [Mobile Tools] Phone`

Cloud Services
==============
- E2EE isn't offered on their Nextcloud instance, citing data loss concerns, yet they leaked user data to other users
 - https://community.e.foundation/t/service-announcement-26-may/41252/27
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//e/OS#Data_leakage_incident
 - Nextcloud Server Side Encryption (SSE) is NOT secure as they can trivally record your password on login-flow and decrypt your files
  - https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/encryption_configuration.html
   - "The encryption app does not protect your data if your Nextcloud server is compromised, and it does not prevent Nextcloud administrators from reading user’s files."
   - Furthermore it doesn't encrypt file or folder names
    - "It encrypts only the contents of files, and not filenames and directory structures."
  - SSE was demonstrated as useless in the leak

- Trackers in their newsletter
 - https://web.archive.org/web/20221203154857/https://community.e.foundation/t/tracker-into-the-e-foundation-letter/38178

Weather [DEPRECATED]
====================
- Performs requests over HTTP, leaking your location to any observer
 - https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/Weather/-/blob/2c623c7a9b4a341dd3fb6a2545e84ebf850d780b/app/src/main/java/foundation/e/weather/utils/Constants.java#L73


Not Covered (nuanced or needs research/sources)
===============================================
- The use of CleanAPK
- The state of kernel security patching
- The use/recommendation of TWRP for recovery
- IMSI to SUPL
- Which SUPL server is default? (for example many "degoogled" systems use supl.vodafone.com... which is just a CNAME to Google)
- Signature spoofing support, with no restrictions
